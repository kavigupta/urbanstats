This directory contains election data for the 2024 elections. The data is sourced from the following locations:

Most states have data downloaded (on 2025-08-31) from [the nyt github via the instructions for the national data](https://github.com/nytimes/presidential-precinct-map-2024?tab=readme-ov-file#download-national-data) and saved as `nyt-precincts-with-results.topojson.gz`. This has data for many states, but not all. Some states only have township data, we consider this good enough. However, there are also:

- AL: sourced from [RDH](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/alabama-2024-general-election-precinct-level-results-and-boundaries/).
- CA: ??
- FL: ??
- ID: ??
- IL: ??
- IN: ??
- LA: ??
