                    Urban Stats is a database of various statistics, computed largely from Census Data but also other
                    sources, for a variety of regions in the United States. The goal of this project is to provide a
                    resource for people to learn about the places they live, and to provide a resource for journalists
                    and researchers to find interesting statistics about places they are studying.
                </p>
