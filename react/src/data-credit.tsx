                                For each grid point, we compute each of our weather statistics.

                                We compute mean high temperatures by aggregating the daily high temperature for each day
                                in the time period, and then taking the mean of these values. We perform a similar
                                computation for mean high dew point. Using these values, we compute the mean high heat index.

                                We compute mean rainfall and snowfall by aggregating the hourly rainfall and snowfall.
                                Codes 1 (rain) and 2 (freezing rain) are coded as rain, and codes 5 (snow), 6 (wet snow),
                                and 8 (ice pellets) are coded as snow. Code 7 (mixed) is coded as 50/50 rain/snow.

                                using bilinear interpolation. We then compute the population weighted average of these

                        Election Data is approximate and uses

                        match official results. Data is from the 2016 and 2020 US Presidential general elections. N/A
                        indicates that the statistic is not available for the given geography, possibly because the
                        precinct boundaries in the dataset are slightly inaccurate, or there are no results for
                        the precincts overlapping the geography.

                        We use the 2020 population estimates, which are
                        not perfectly accurate in all cases, but should be the best match to the 2020 Census numbers
                        we are using for the US data. To compute PW density, we treat each cell as effectively homogenous,
                        but since the cells are all smaller than 1 square kilometer, this should not be a major issue for
                        radii above 1km (which is the smallest radius we use for GHS-POP data).
